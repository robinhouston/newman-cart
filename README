This is the source code for the program "cart", which calculates cartograms
using the diffusion-based method of Gastner and Newman (2004).  For
details, see http://www.umich.edu/~mejn/cart/ .

This fork has some added instrumentation, and turns some compile-time options
into run-time options that can be selected on the command line.
